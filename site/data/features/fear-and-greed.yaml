description: "Bitcoin is currently trading as an unregulated free market. It is free from the FTC, the CFTC, the SEC, the NYSE, the CME and the host of other regulatory agencies. As such, the trading patterns of Bitcoin are pure, raw, and emotional. The Pro Bitcoin Trading Manual teaches you how to master your fear and greed which provides a significant trading advantage over those who still trade emotionally."
