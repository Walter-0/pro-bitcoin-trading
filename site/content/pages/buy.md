As traders, we have come to learn that most trading is 20% technical knowledge and 80% emotion. Bitcoin trading is no different. But because Bitcoin trading is unregulated, it is raw, pure, emotion. There are no rules to prevent you or anyone else from initiating almost any trade you desire. There are no margin requirements and no regulatory body to “protect” you.

This freedom invites wildly speculative trading fueled primarily by fear and greed. These two emotional states, when expressed through trading, are highly predictable. This once in a lifetime, rare combination of multiple trading styles, numerous inexperienced traders, a new currency trading market, mixed with basic human optimism, form predictable patterns in the Bitcoin price movements.
